            <p>Although snow leopards have ruled the mountains of Central Asia for thousands of years, recently their numbers are dropping in the following countries: </p>
    
            <ul>
                <li>China</li>
                <li>Bhutan</li>
                <li>Nepal</li>
                <li>India</li>
                <li>Pakistan</li>
                <li>Afghanistan</li>
                <li>Russia</li>
                <li>Mongolia</li>
            </ul>
    
            <h2>Causes of Snow Leopard Population Decline</h2>
    
            <p>Many factors contribute to their declining numbers in these countries. Some of the top causes are: </p>
    
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Climate change</strong> - greatest long term threat that could destroy 30% of their habitat</li>
                <li><strong>Local communities</strong> - kill the animals that snow leopards prey upon</li>
                <li><strong>Killed by farmers</strong> - when they are forced to prey on livestock to survive</li>
                <li><strong>Human settlement in their range</strong> - forces them to survive in smaller areas with less prey</li>
            </ol>
